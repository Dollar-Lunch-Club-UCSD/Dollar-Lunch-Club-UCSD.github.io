            <h2> What's our deal? </h2>
            <p>
               Dollar Lunch Club is a community at UCSD that cooks and eats together in pursuit of <strong>food justice through mutual aid and sustainable practices</strong>. 
               <br>
               We are composed of graduate and undergraduate students from many departments and backgrounds. We invite faculty, staff, and any other members of the San Diego community who'd like to join us.
            </p>

                    How do I hear about Dollar Lunches that are happening soon?
                </summary>
                The most consistent way to hear about our lunches is through our Instagram, which you can find at @dollar_lunch_club . We also try to email department mailing lists, ping Slacks, and tell our friends. If all else fails, try emailing <code> dollar dot lunch dot club dot ucsd @ gmail dot com</code>

                There's no "have to" here - mutual aid is about giving what you can, and taking what you need, while forming strong community bonds. No matter your circumstances: if you're hungry, or you want to make new friends, we invite you to join us.
                <br>
