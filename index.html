            <h2> What's our deal? </h2>
            <p>
               Dollar Lunch Club is a community at UCSD that cooks and eats together in pursuit of <strong>food justice through mutual aid and sustainable practices</strong>. 
               <br>
               We are composed of graduate and undergraduate students from many departments and backgrounds. We invite faculty, staff, and any other members of the San Diego community who'd like to join us.
            </p>

                </summary>
                Yes you can! We'd love to have you. Whether you're an undergrad, a janitor, a teaching assistant, a grad student, a construction worker, or just passing through, you're welcome to join us.

                    How do I hear about Dollar Lunches that are happening soon?
                </summary>
                The most consistent way to hear about our lunches is through our Instagram, which you can find at @dollar_lunch_club . You can check the Google Calendar embedded below, although currently Instagram is our priority. We also try to email department mailing lists, ping Slacks, and tell our friends. If all else fails, try emailing <code> dollar dot lunch dot club dot ucsd @ gmail dot com</code>

                    How much do I have to pay?
                </summary>
                There's no "have to" here - mutual aid is about giving what you can, and taking what you need, while forming strong community bonds. No matter your circumstances: if you're hungry, or you want to make new friends, we invite you to join us.
                <br>
